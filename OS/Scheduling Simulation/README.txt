So the main file proj2.c will simulate cpu scheduling for processes

To compile you must use this line of code "gcc proj2.c -o proj2"

To be able to run the executable you must use one of the following combinations:

Template: "proj2 input_file [FCFS|RR|SRTF] [time quantum]"

Example 1: "proj2 input_file FCFS"
Example 2: "proj2 input_file SRTF"
Example 1: "proj2 input_file RR 2"
