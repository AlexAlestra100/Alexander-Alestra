NOTE: So I tried the approach the professor said in the pdf to flip the numbers back into place for the flag and food station on the screen. When attempted it would just remove them in general. So I commented out the line that did that so it wouldn't remove the numbers for flag and food station. Also the last assignment the grader said I did not include the jar file. I checked and it was with my zip. So if you read this it should be in the zip file.
